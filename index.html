    <p>Robotic arms move along limited spherical paths defined by their joints. The path of the tool at the end of the robot corresponds (at moments) to the shape of the object being fabricated. In contrast, the other joints of the robot move and respond
        to accommodate the motion of the tool, moving in sometimes surprising and unexpected ways. Some of these motions seem almost human. Consider the human motion of swinging a hammer. The person swinging the hammer focuses on the point of impact,
        the head of a nail. However, a whole series of joints respond to this motion: shoulder, fingers, elbow, and wrist. Similarly, as designers, we focus on the object to be fabricated by the robot, and perhaps less on the sets of movements that define
        the motion. This semester we will shift our focus from shape to tool path. In lieu of developing boundary representations and using standard tools to cut them into to toolpaths, students will design tool paths as objects, without the aid of intermediary
        geometry. Students will design algorithms using the equation of the unit sphere to develop single polylines that will double as the sole representation of the object and the precise description of the tool path of the robot. In doing so, the we
        will revisit the history of architectural drawing in which the drawing of the architectural object is both representation and the primary information with which it is fabricated. </p>
